# Chatbot-V3
For the Minor Real Fake, Real Impact, I created a chatbot with Pyton. This chatbot is built with NLTK, TensorFlow, and neural networks. It is highly customizable and can be modified to suit your needs. This chatbot was made with a tutorial from [pycodemates.com.](https://www.pycodemates.com/2021/11/build-a-AI-chatbot-using-python-and-deep-learning.html)

# What have i done
I've added several features that make a chatbot familiar according to the literature. I have used this paper: *The Effect of Design Features on Relationship Quality with Embodied Conversational Agents: A Systematic Review* [(link)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12369-020-00680-7) 

I also apply on the knowledge gained from the AI trainer course from [conversationdesigninstitute.com.](conversationdesigninstitute.com) 




# How it works
chatbot built with NLTK, TensorFlow, and neural networks is a type of artificial intelligence program that is designed to simulate conversation with human users through natural language processing techniques. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a Python library that provides tools for processing and analyzing natural language data, such as text and speech. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library that can be used to build and train neural networks. Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and are commonly used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. Together, these tools and technologies can be used to create a chatbot that can understand and respond to natural language input from users in a human-like manner.

# What the chatbot can do
The chatbot demonstrates the techniques mentioned above. The following questions are possible:

- my name is (.*)
- what is your name ?
-
And more!

# Why this project
I have done the minor Real Fake, Real Impact. During the minor, I immersed myself in AI and Digital Humans. One of the topics was learning the basics of pyton. With the knowledge learned, I created 4 different chatbots. Each chatbot was built with different techniques and with a diffrent purpose.
