# How it works

# What the chatbot can do
The chatbot demonstrates the techniques mentioned above. The following questions are possible:

- my name is (.*)
- what is your name ?

And more!

# Why this project
I have done the minor Real Fake, Real Impact. During the minor, I immersed myself in AI and Digital Humans. One of the topics was learning the basics of pyton. With the knowledge learned, I created 4 different chatbots. Each chatbot was built with different techniques and with a diffrent purpose.
